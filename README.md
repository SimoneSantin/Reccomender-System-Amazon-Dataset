# README - Reccomender-System-Amazon-Dataset
Analysis of Amazon CD and Vinyl reviews in Python and Development of a Recommender System for the users.
## Project Overview
The goal of the project was to first analyze the reviews from a dataset representing Amazon CDs and vinyl over the years by creating visualizations and examining their correlations.
Subsequently, I focused on building a clustering algorithm to identify groups of users based on their ratings and reviews. Then, I developed various recommender systems using different algorithms and transformers on the filtered dataset to compare their accuracy and the resulting recommendation lists.
## Content Overview
The following topics were explored during the project:
  1. Data and correlation analysis
  2. Clustering algorithms
  3. Collaborative filtering in recommender systems
  4. Content-based filtering in recommender systems
  5. Sentence embeddings with Transformers and BoW
